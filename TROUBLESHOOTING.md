# 🔧 Jello Tetrix Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚀 Quick Test

1. **Open the debug test file:**
   - Open `debug-test.html` directly in your browser
   - This will test all features without needing deployment
   - Check browser console (F12) for detailed logs

## 📋 Feature Checklist

### ✅ Carter Concessio Credit
- **Expected**: "Made by Carter Concessio" appears below game title
- **Location**: App.jsx lines 42-49
- **Status**: ✅ Should be working

### 🎪 Jello Physics Features
- **Expected**: Blocks wobble when pieces collide
- **Triggers**: 
  - When piece can't move (collision)
  - When piece lands
  - When rotating pieces
- **Debug**: Open browser console to see collision logs
- **Test**: Use debug-test.html to verify animations work

### 🖥️ Fullscreen Mode
- **Expected**: Purple ⛶ button next to other game controls
- **Function**: Expands game to fill entire screen
- **Debug**: Console shows fullscreen attempts
- **Test**: Use debug-test.html to verify fullscreen API works

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Features not visible"
**Symptoms**: Can't see fullscreen button or credit text
**Solutions**:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if CSS files are loading properly

### Issue 2: "Jello effects not working"
**Symptoms**: Blocks don't wobble on collision
**Solutions**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for "Collision detected" messages
3. Check if CSS animations are enabled in browser
4. Verify particles are enabled in settings

### Issue 3: "Fullscreen not working"
**Symptoms**: Clicking fullscreen button does nothing
**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Some browsers block fullscreen without user gesture
3. Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
4. Ensure you're not in an iframe

### Issue 4: "Deploy changes not showing"
**Symptoms**: Deployed version doesn't have new features
**Solutions**:
1. Check if build completed successfully
2. Clear browser cache and hard refresh
3. Check if correct branch was deployed
4. Verify file changes were committed and pushed

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported:
- ✅ Chrome 70+
- ✅ Firefox 65+
- ✅ Edge 79+
- ✅ Safari 13+

### Partially Supported:
- ⚠️ Internet Explorer: Fullscreen may not work
- ⚠️ Older mobile browsers: Reduced animations

## 📱 Mobile Testing

1. **Touch Controls**: Touch buttons should appear at bottom
2. **Fullscreen**: Should work on mobile browsers
3. **Jello Effects**: May be reduced on low-performance devices
4. **Settings**: Particles can be disabled for better performance

## 🛠️ Debug Mode

Add `?debug=true` to URL for enhanced logging:
```
https://your-game-url.vercel.app?debug=true
```

This enables:
- Detailed collision logging
- Fullscreen attempt logs
- Particle creation logs
- Performance metrics

## 📞 Final Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify:

1. **✅ Files Changed**: All source files have latest changes
2. **✅ Build Success**: No build errors in deployment
3. **✅ Cache Cleared**: Browser cache cleared
4. **✅ Console Checked**: No JavaScript errors in console
5. **✅ Debug Test**: debug-test.html works locally

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Game Start:
1. See "Jello Tetrix" title with Carter Concessio credit
2. Purple fullscreen button visible
3. Start game and play normally

### During Play:
1. Move pieces - when they hit blocks, jiggle effects occur
2. Particles appear on collisions (yellow), drops (red), line clears (gold)
3. Fullscreen button works to expand game

### Visual Effects:
1. Blocks wobble with rotation and scaling
2. Brightness changes during jiggle
3. Particle effects with smooth animations

## 🚀 Still Not Working?

If features still don't work after following this guide:

1. **Check deployment URL**: Ensure you're viewing the latest deployment
2. **Try incognito mode**: Rules out browser extensions/cache issues
3. **Test on different device**: Isolate device-specific issues
4. **Check network tab**: Ensure all CSS/JS files are loading

The debug-test.html file should help identify if it's a code issue or deployment issue!
